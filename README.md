In this team project we intend to develop a website named ShakePaw. 
At the present stage, we envision the main function of this website 
to be the personal blog for Noodle, a Maltipoo belongs to our group 
member Yunke Li, and Emma, a Samoyed belongs to Wendi Luo, we plan 
to put some interesting life stories and pictures of them. Other 
than this, we also plan to let this website served as a social 
platform for pets and their owners. Registered users can upload 
pictures and provide some basic information like gender, breed, 
age, location of their dog.
